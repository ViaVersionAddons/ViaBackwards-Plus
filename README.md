# ViaBackwards+
### This resources pack is not an official fork of the [ViaBackwards](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaBackwards) plugin, it's just fan-made addon!
Enchance the ViaBackwards experience by backporting the item models and textures.Â 

The pack uses the expanded override system providet by the mod [Chime](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chime-fabric) to identify the items by their custom name and give them the look of what they have in the newer versions of Minecraft.
