  <h1>The backporter pack!</h1>
  <h3>Requires the mod <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/chime" target="_blank">Chime</a> to work</h3>
  <p><strong>This Minecraft pack enhances the gameplay experience with the ViaBackwards plugin</strong>, which allow players to connect to newer servers with an older client. The pack requires the Chime mod to work, which helps identify the items by their custom name or custom NBT data, and assigns the correct model and texture to them. The best part of this pack is that if you put an another resourcespack on top of it, it will load the textures from that!<br><strong><span style="color: red;">Please note that this pack is not an official addon from the <a href="https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaBackwards/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">ViaBackwards team</a>, and it's just fan-made.</span></strong></p>

  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Backports item textures from newer versions of Minecraft</li>
    <li>Compatible with other resources packs</li>
    <li>Enhances gameplay experience</li>
    <li>Support all the way down to 1.16</li>
    <li>Works even when the items are renamed!</li>
    <li>Some easter-eggs</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How it Works</h3>
  <p>The pack works by identifying items by their ViaBackwards Protocol ID, which helps determine the correct model and texture to assign to them. For example, "Copper ore" has a protocol id of "44", the Chime mod will help the pack recognize it as a Copper ore and assign the correct model and texture to it.</p>
  <p>Think of it like a special tag on each item that tells the pack what it is, so the pack knows how to make it look and behave correctly. This way, you get to enjoy the latest Minecraft textures and the easy identification of items, even if you're playing an older version of the game!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep the pack up-today</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ViaVersionAddons/ViaBackwards-Plus/issues/3" target="_blank">Port the pack to Optifine</a></li>
  <li>Create a custom ViaBackwards version for the smoothest experience</li>
  <li> Fix every bug</li>
  <li>Go below 1.16 (only if the pack get popular enought so I can ask the mod's dev to backport the mod)</li>
  <li>Add more easter eggs, maybe</li>
</ul>

<summary><h4>For Optifine Users</h4></summary>

**The Optifine versions of the pack is in the works, and will be done in the pack's 2.0 version with the release of Minecraft 1.21.**

The pack will start with the newly added and 1.17 items then it will move on to the 1.20 items and lastly do the 1.19 items, because there's a smaller Optifine pack called <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/viavisual/" target="_blank">ViaVisual</a>. If you want to speed up the development you can do it on <a href="https://github.com/ViaVersionAddons/ViaBackwards-Plus/tree/dev" target="_blank">Github</a>
