  <h1>ViaBackwards+</h1>
  <h4>Requires the mod <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/chime" target="_blank">Chime</a> to work</h4>
  <p><strong>This Minecraft pack enhances the gameplay experience with the ViaBackwards plugin</strong>, which allow players to connect to newer servers with an older client. The pack requires the Chime mod to work, which helps identify the items by their custom name or custom NBT data, and assigns the correct model and texture to them. The best part of this pack is that if you put an another resourcespack on top of it, it will load the textures from that!<br><strong>Please note that this pack is not an official addon from the <a href="https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaBackwards" target:"_blank">ViaBackwards team</a>, and it's just fan-made.</span></strong></p>

  <h3>How it Works</h3>
  <p>The pack works by identifying items by their custom name or custom NBT data, which helps determine the correct model and texture to assign to them. For example, if you have a diamond sword with a custom name "Excalibur," the Chime mod will help the pack recognize it as a diamond sword and assign the correct model and texture to it.</p>
  <p>Think of it like a special tag on each item that tells the pack what it is, so the pack knows how to make it look and behave correctly. This way, you get to enjoy the latest Minecraft textures and the easy identification of items, even if you're playing an older version of the game!</p>
