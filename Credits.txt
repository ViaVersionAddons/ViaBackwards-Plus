Here's a list of the creator of the assets that I used in this pack (in order that I used their work, not in how much I used them):

Mojang Studios: https://minecraft.net (Every backported item's model and texture)
Vanilla Tweaks: https://vanillatweaks.net/ (Some easter egg textures)
EasterEggs by AlinoeTheBunny: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/eastereggs (The literal easter egg textures)
